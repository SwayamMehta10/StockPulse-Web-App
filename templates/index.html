                <b>Stock market definition </b><br />
                The stock market is where investors buy and sell shares of
                companies. Itâ€™s a set of exchanges where companies issue shares
                and other securities for trading. It also includes
                over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces where investors trade
                securities directly with each other (rather than through an
                exchange).
                <br /><br /><br />
                <b>The stock market explained </b><br />
                In practice, the term "stock market" often refers to one of the
                major stock market indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial
                Average or the S&P 500. These represent large sections of the
                stock market. Because it's hard to track every single company,
                the performance of the indexes is viewed as representative of
                the entire market. You might see a news headline that says the
                stock market has moved lower or that the stock market has closed
                up or down for the day. This often means stock market indexes
                have moved up or down, and stocks within the index have gained
                or lost value. Investors who buy and sell stocks hope to profit
                through this movement in stock prices.
